Deploy a super scary velociraptor on failed login attempts.

== Description ==

Ever wanted to display a velociraptor when someone uses an incorrect username/password? Well now you can!

This plugin will also track failed login attempts via a handy [dashboard widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/raptor/screenshots/). This gives you an insight into what usernames people are trying to log in with.
